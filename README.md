## TL;DR

We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable **2.5D models**. Our approach decomposes a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders — up to **23 layers** including hair, face, eyes, clothing, accessories, and more.

### Huggingface Space

We have prepared [a Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/24yearsold/see-through-demo) with ZeroGPU, so that if you register with HuggingFace, you should be able to run 1-2 PSD extractions per day (approximately 2-3 mins each, at 1280 resolution).

## Usage

### Layer Decomposition (main pipeline)

`inference_psd.py` runs the full See-through pipeline: it applies the **LayerDiff 3D** model
for transparent layer generation and the fine-tuned **Marigold** model for pseudo-depth
inference, then stratifies the character into up to **23 semantic layers** and exports a
layered PSD file. Note that the separation for head and body are in two continuous stages, which
may lead to a longer time than the original model mentioned in the paper. 

```bash
# Decompose a single image into a layered PSD
python inference/scripts/inference_psd.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd

# Process a directory of images
python inference/scripts/inference_psd.py \
  --srcp path/to/image_folder/ \
  --save_to_psd
```

Output is saved to `workspace/layerdiff_output/` by default. Each result includes:
- A layered `.psd` file with semantically separated layers
- Intermediate depth maps and segmentation masks

> **Note:** This uses our most recent model with 23-layer body part separation (V3).


Once you have finished the layer splitting, you can further process the PSD with the scripts in `inference/scripts/heuristic_partseg.py` for depth-based or left-right stratification.


```bash
# Split based on depth
python inference/scripts/heuristic_partseg.py seg_wdepth --srcp workspace/test_samples_output/PV_0047_A0020.psd --target_tags handwear


#Left-right split
python inference/scripts/heuristic_partseg.py seg_wlr --srcp workspace/test_samples_output/PV_0047_A0020_wdepth.psd --target_tags handwear-1
```

### Low-VRAM Users

The default pipeline runs at bf16 precision and requires approximately 12-16 GB of VRAM at 1280 resolution.

**12 GB GPUs**: Enable group offload to reduce peak VRAM to ~10 GB at 1280 resolution:

```bash
python inference/scripts/inference_psd.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd \
  --group_offload
```

**8 GB GPUs**: Use the NF4 quantized pipeline, which uses 4-bit quantized model weights. This achieves ~8 GB peak VRAM at 1280 resolution, and can be further reduced by lowering the resolution with group offload:

```bash
# Install bitsandbytes (one-time)
pip install -r requirements-inference-bnb.txt

# Run with NF4 quantization (default: group_offload on, depth resolution 720)
python inference/scripts/inference_psd_quantized.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd

# For even lower VRAM, reduce layerdiff resolution to 1024
python inference/scripts/inference_psd_quantized.py \
  --srcp assets/test_image.png \
  --save_to_psd \
  --resolution 1024
```

The quantized models are hosted on HuggingFace and downloaded automatically on first run. Quality is close to the full-precision model (PSNR ~30 dB, SSIM ~0.96 vs bf16 baseline).

> **Note:** Group offload trades speed for VRAM savings (roughly 1.5x slower). NF4 quantization has minimal speed overhead but reduces model weight memory.

### Preparing the dataset for training (e.g., Live2D Parsing)

We have provided a separate repo for you to prepare the dataset for training the Live2D parsing model. Please refer to [CubismPartExtr](https://github.com/shitagaki-lab/CubismPartExtr) to know how to download the sample model files and prepare your workspace folder. 

After that, refer to the `README_datapipeline.md` for the instructions on how to run the data parsing scripts to prepare the dataset for inspection and training. 

### User Interface

Once you have prepared your data, you may go ahead with the user interfaces. Refer to [UI Readme](ui/README.md) for the instructions on how to launch the UI.

> We currently require the `workspace/datasets/` folder located at the repository root to launch the UI, as it contains the sample data for demonstration. We will work on making this more flexible in the future.

> We recommend installing the `mmdet` tier dependencies to ensure the UI can launch successfully. 


### Training

We have our training scripts ready, but we are still working on the documentation. We will release them no later than 2026/04/12. Please stay tuned!

## Discussion: Is this Image-to-Live2D?

We don't think so — at least, not yet.

While we produces 2.5D layer decompositions from a single image,
the full Image-to-Live2D pipeline requires significantly more:

1. **Finer artistic decomposition.** Live2D models demand layers designed with specific
   deformation behaviors in mind. Our automatic decomposition prioritizes semantic
   correctness, but a Live2D artist would make different artistic choices about how
   to split layers for natural-looking motion.

2. **Rigging.** After decomposition, a Live2D model needs a deformation mesh, physics
   parameters, and motion curves — this rigging process is arguably the most critical
   (and labor-intensive) step, and it is not covered in this project.

3. **Artistic intent.** Professional Live2D works are crafted holistically: the layer
   structure, inpainting style, and rigging are designed together. Automating one step
   in isolation cannot replicate this.

That said, we believe our decomposition can serve as a useful **starting point** for
Live2D artists by eliminating some of the most tedious part of the workflow, such as manual segmentation
and occluded region inpainting.

## Changelog

**2026-04-02**
- Multiple memory optimizations; added suggestions for low-VRAM users (group offload, NF4 quantization).
